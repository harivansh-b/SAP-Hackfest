# üì¶ BCON AI ‚Äî SAP Hackfest Submission (Round 2 )

Welcome to the **BCON AI** project ‚Äî a smart supply chain and transparency platform powered by SAP technology, with a focus on end-to-end trust in food and ingredient sourcing for restaurants, suppliers, delivery aggregators, and end consumers.

## üí° Project Overview

Modern food supply chains in India face acute challenges:

- **Lack of ingredient traceability**
- **Food adulteration incidents**

**BCON AI** addresses these with:

- **Real-time supplier and certification verification**
- **End-to-end traceability using blockchain and ERP integration**
- **Centralized dashboards for operations, ordering, and audits**
- **Digital transparency for consumers via QR codes and ingredient reports**

Built atop **SAP BTP** and **SAP HANA**, our system connects suppliers, restaurants, delivery platforms, and consumers with secure, transparent data.

## üë§ Key Personas

- **Priya Mehta**: Restaurant manager seeking reliable supplies and less manual overhead.
- **Rajat Verma**: Zomato compliance lead aiming for seamless, automated safety checks.
- **Ankit**: Health-conscious consumer searching for proof of ingredient origins and certifications.

## üöÄ Solution Highlights

- **Instant Certification Checks**: Scan or search for supplier FSSAI/NABL compliance instantly, eliminating manual proof submission.
